# SpotifyColorTool

This is a quick script/proof of concept for creating color-coded playlists on Spotify!

* This tool was used to dynamically create playlists out of Spotify's feature playlist based on their color! 

#### Here are some of the resulting playlists generated from this script:

* These playlists were created with the help of [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/) and some good old fashioned K-means clustering to determine the dominant color.
